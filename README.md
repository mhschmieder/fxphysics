# fxphysicscontrols

The fxphysicscontrols library is for JavaFX GUI controls support when using the jphysics library in a JavaFX application context.

This library is split off from my fxgui, as physics is a large umbrella for many concepts that don't come up in lots of applications that are more run-of-the-mill than the scientific and engineering desktop applications that I tend to work on.
